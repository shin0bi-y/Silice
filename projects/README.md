# Silice example projects

Looking at examples is a great way to learn and experiment. So I prepared several projects, from small to big, to show off Silice features. Some of these projects are still under active development, and evolve together with the language (DooM-chip, I am looking at you!). 

Note that these designs are entirely created from scratch with Silice, from SDRAM, HDMI, VGA, OLED and LCD controlers to dividers and multipliers, importing only tiny bits of Verilog (for e.g. PLLs). Most of the designs rely on common functions grouped in the *common* folder.

To build a design please refer to the [building](#building-the-examples) section below and the README of the project.
All designs can be simulated with Icarus/Verilator, and many will work right out of the box on real hardware. Please refer
to the README of each project.

A few projects rely on some external hardware (typical, low cost things: OLED, keypad, LCD, etc.), this is all detailed in the README of the projects.

## Detailed tutorials

Some of the projects have more detailed explanations and walk-throughs:
- [HDMI tutorial](hdmi_test/)
- [Compact RV32I RISC-V](ice-v/)
- [Terrain fly-over demo](terrain/)
- [RISC-V + graphics framework](fire-v/)
- [SDRAM tutorial](sdram_test/)
- [streaming audio from sdcard](audio_sdcard_streamer/)
- [pipelined sort](pipeline_sort/)

## Building the examples

All examples are in the *projects* directory. 

To build a project, make sure your board is ready to be programmed, open a command line (MinGW64 under Windows), enter the project directory and type `make <target board>` ; for instance `make icestick`. 

Let's take an example! We will build the 'divint bare' demo for simulation with icarus. Do the following:

*Note:* under Windows please use a MinGW shell, please refer to the [getting started](../GetStarted.md) guide.

```
cd silice/projects/divint_bare
make icarus
```
If everthing goes well you should see in the last console output:
```
20043 /   -817 =    -24
```
and a gtkwave window opens to let you explore the produced signals.

A good project to start with Silice is *silice/project/blinky*.

## Extra hardware

### VGA

Some projects require extra hardware, for instance a VGA DAC (a bunch of resistors on a breadbord will do!). This is simple and fun to do, so I highly encourage you [to make one](DIYVGA.md). All VGA and SDRAM projects can be simulated with the verilator framework (see next section), which outputs images of what you would see on screen. They can also be simulated with Icarus, which outputs a fst file that can be explored with gtkwave or visualized with *silicehe*.

### OLED

To configure your OLED setup, edit the *oled.ice* file in [common/oled.ice](common/oled.ice) to specify the driver and resolution being used.
The OLED library supports the SDD1351 and ST7789 drivers. Also checkout the specific pinout used for your board.

# Notes and tips

- If you are under Windows and run into trouble, checkout the notes on my [fpga-binutils repo](https://github.com/sylefeb/fpga-binutils) (end of page).

- Some Verilog code in *projects/common* comes from the [Alchitry](https://alchitry.com/) demos for the MojoV3. Also checkout [Lucid](https://alchitry.com/pages/lucid-fpga-tutorials) it is great for learning low-level FPGA programming (similar to Verilog but more beginner-friendly). The website features good tutorials on FPGAs in general.
