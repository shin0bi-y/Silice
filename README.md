## What is Silice?

*Silice* simplifies prototyping and implementing algorithms on FPGAs. It provides a comfortable yet thin abstraction above *Verilog* (a typical hardware description language), simplifying design without loosing precise control over the hardware. It provides "quality of life" features to group signals, define generic interfaces and circuitries, instantiate block RAMs, describe pipelines, deal with multiple clock domains and automatically manage flip-flops. 
It gives the (optional) ability to write parts of your design as sequences of operations, subroutines that can be called, and to use control flow statements such as while and break, describing operations and algorithms that run in parallel and are precisely in sync.
Silice detects combinatorial loops and many other error-prone cases, and features a Lua-preprocessor enabling advanced code generation.

Silice does not aim to be a high level synthesis language: it *remains close to the hardware* and lets you fully exploit FPGA architectures, with a fine grain control on how your design maps to the hardware: You remain in control of what happens at each and every clock cycle, with predictable rules for flow control, how and when execution states appear, how flip-flops map to variables, and what gets registered or not. In fact, if you chose so you can design in a way that is very similar to Verilog, while still benefiting from the "quality of life" improvements of Silice syntax. 
This allows to refine an initial prototype from concept to efficient implementation. 
Silice compiles to and inter-operates with Verilog: you can directly instantiate and bind with existing modules.

The language comes with a complete build system, [many examples](projects/README.md) and [basic components](projects/common/) (VGA, HDMI, OLED, UART, and SDRAM controllers). The build system allows to [get started](GetStarted.md) easily, and already supports many [popular boards](frameworks/boards/boards.json) such as the IceBreaker, ULX3S, Fomu and IceStick.

You do not need an FPGA to start with Silice: designs and their outputs (e.g. VGA signal) can be simulated and visualized. Silice works great with the open source FGPA toolchain (yosys/nextpnr/icestorm), see our [Ice40 and ECP5 examples](projects/README.md).

While I developed Silice for my own needs, I hope you'll find it useful for your projects!

## Design principles and features

Silice does not abstract away the hardware: the programmer remains in control and very close to hardware features. It provides syntactic helpers simplifying design and reuse (signal groups, generic interfaces, pipelining). Silice can also help you reason in terms of execution flow and operation sequences. However, this is not mandatory and you can also take full control and use a more direct hardware design style. When developing with Silice you can focus [optimization efforts](learn-silice/Guidelines.md) on critical parts, and use a simpler approach in other parts of the design.

The main features are:
- A clean, simple syntax that clearly exposes the flow of operations and where clock cycles are spent.
- Precise rules regarding flow control (loops, calls) and their clock cycle consumption.
- Familiar hardware constructs such as always blocks, instantiation, expression tracking (wires).
- An optional flow-control oriented design style (automatic FSM generation), that naturally integrates within a design: while, break, subroutines.
- The possibility to easily describe pipelines.
- Automatically takes care of creating flip-flops for variables, with automatic pruning (e.g. const or bindings).
- Generic interfaces and grouped IOs for easy reuse and modular designs.
- Generic circuitries that can be instantiated and reused easily.
- Explicit clock domains and reset signals.
- Familiar syntax with both C and Verilog inspired elements.
- Inter-operates with Verilog, allowing to import and reuse existing modules.
- Powerful LUA-based pre-processor.

These examples are different and representative of this approach:
- The [voxel space terrain](projects/terrain/README.md) is relying on Silice sequential flow syntax.
- The [fire-v](projects/fire-v/README.md) project is a graphical RISCV framework with a [RV32I processor](projects/fire-v/doc/fire-v.md) that relies mostly on non-sequential constructs.
- The [SDRAM controllers](projects/sdram_test/README.md) use a mixed style.
- The [pipeline sort](projects/pipeline_sort/README.md) is an example of using the pipeline syntax (**experimental, may change**). 

### A first example:
*(see also the full [blinky tutorial](learn-silice/blinky/README.md))*

##### Code:
```c
1  algorithm main(output uint8 led) {   
2    uint28 counter = 0;      // a 28 bits unsigned integer
3    led := counter[20,8];    // LEDs updated every clock with the 8 most significant bits  
4    while (1) {              // forever
5      counter = counter + 1; // increment counter
6    }  
7  }
```

##### Compile:
```
cd projects
cd blinky
make mojov3
```

##### Enjoy!

![First example in action on a Mojo v3](docs/figures/first_example.gif)

##### Explanations:

Line 1 is the entry point of any Silice hardware: the main algorithm. Line 2 we define
a 28 bits unsigned int, initialized to 0. Initializers are mandatory and are always constants.
Line 3 we request that the output led tracks the eight most significant bits of the counter variable.
The syntax [20,8] means 8 bits wide starting from bit 20. The assignment to led
uses the := operator which is an *always* assignment: led is now automatically 
updated with counter after each rising clock. Such assignments have to appear
at the top of an algorithm, right before any other instruction.

Finally, lines 4-6 define the infinite loop that increments the counter. Of course the
28 bit counter will ultimately overflow and go back to 0, hence the cyclic LED light pattern.
In this case, the loop takes exactly one cycle to execute: we have one increment per cycle 
at 50 MHz (the clock frequency of the Mojo v3).

We then compile with silice. The -f parameter indicates which framework to use: this is an
FPGA plateform dependent wrapper code. Here we are using the Mojo framework with LEDs only.
Several other frameworks are provided, and it is easy to write your own. 

The -o parameter indicates where to write the Verilog output. In this example we overwrite 
the main file of a pre-existing project, which is then compiled using Xilinx ISE toolchain.
Fear not, we also have examples working with yosys, nextpnr and [project icestorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/)!

### Cycles and control flow:

Here is another small example outlining a core principle of Silice:

##### Code:
```c
1 algorithm main() {   
2    brom int12 sintbl[4096] = {...}
3    ...
4    while (1) { // render loop
5      // get cos/sin view
6      sintbl.addr = (viewangle) & 4095;
7  ++:
8      sinview     = sintbl.rdata;
9      sintbl.addr = (viewangle + 1024) & 4095;
10 ++:
11     cosview     = sintbl.rdata;
12     ...
```
##### Explanations:

This code is storing a sine table in a block ROM and accesses it to obtain a cosine and sine for the current view angle.
Note the use of the **++:** *step* operator in lines 7 and 10. This explicitely splits the exectution flow and introduces a one cycle delay, here waiting for the brom to output its result in field *rdata* for the select address in *addr*.
Anything in between is considered combinational; for instance lines 8 and 9 are evaluated in parallel on hardware, as they
each produce two pieces of independent circuitry.

## Getting started with Silice

See the [getting started](GetStarted.md) guide. Silice runs great on Windows, Linux, and macOS!
To start writing code, see [writing your first design](FirstDesign.md).
To see what can be done with Silice, checkout our [example projects](projects/README.md) (all are available in this repo).

## Project status: Alpha release

Silice can already be used to create non trivial designs, from a tiny Risc-V processor to an entire game render loop (visit the [examples](projects/README.md) page).

However Silice is under active development. I decided to open the repo so everyone can join in the fun, but it is far from complete: documentation is lacking, some examples are outdated or far from polished, some very important language features are missing, and many known issues exist (head out to the [Issues](https://github.com/sylefeb/Silice/issues) page). I am confident I can avoid major code breaking syntax changes, but some adjustments may be necessary.

I hope you'll nevertheless enjoy diving into it, and will find it useful. Please let me know your thoughts: comments and contributions are welcome!
