# Silice
## *A language for hardcoding Algorithms into FPGA hardware*

This is the Silice main documentation.

When designing with Silice your code describes circuits. If not done already, it is highly recommended to [watch the introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OhxEY72qxI) (youtube) to get more familiar with this notion and what it entails.

# A first example

This first example assumes two signals: a `button` input (high when
pressed) and a `led` output, each one bit.

The *main* algorithm – the one expected as top level – simply asks the
led to turn on when the button is pressed. We will consider several
versions – all working – to demonstrate basic features of Silice.

Perhaps the most natural version for a programmer not used to FPGAs
would be:

``` c
algorithm main(input uint1 button,output uint1 led) {  
  while (1) {
    led = button;
  }
}
```

This sets `led` to the value of `button` every clock cycle. However, we
could instead specify a *always assignment* between led and button:

``` c
algorithm main(input uint1 button,output uint1 led) {  
  led := button;
}
```

This makes `led` constantly track the value of `button`. A very
convenient feature is that the always assignment can be overridden
at some clock steps, for instance:

``` c
algorithm main(input uint1 button,output uint1 led) {  
  led := 0;
  while (1) {
    if (button == 1) {
      led = 1;
    }
  }  
}
```

Of course this last version is needlessly complicated (the previous one
was minimal), but it shows the principle: `led` is always assigned
0, but this will be overridden whenever the button is pressed. This is
useful to maintain an output to a value that must change only on some
specific event (e.g. producing a pulse).

This first example has an interesting subtlety. The `button` input, if it comes directly from an onboard button, is likely *asynchronous*. This means it can change at anytime, even during a clock cycle. That could lead to trouble with the logic that depends on it. To be safe, a better approach is to *register* the input button, this can be achieved as follows:

``` c
algorithm main(input uint1 button,output uint1 led) {  
  led ::= button;
}
```

Using the `::=` syntax introduces a one cycle latency and inserts a flip-flop between the asynchronous input and whatever comes after. This won't change our results in this toy example but is generally important.

# Terminology

Some terminology we use next:

-   **VIO**: a Variable, Input or Output.
-   **One-cycle block**: A block of operations that require a single
    cycle (no loops, breaks, etc.).
-   **Host hardware framework**: The Verilog glue to the hardware meant
    to run the design. This can also be a glue to Icarus[1] or
    Verilator[2], both frameworks are provided.
-   **Combinational loop**: A circuit where a cyclic
    dependency exists. These lead to unstable hardware synthesis and
    have to be avoided.

# Basic language constructs

## Types

Silice supports signed and unsigned integers with a specified bit width:

-   `int`N with N the bit-width, e.g. `int8`: signed integer.

-   `uint`N with N the bit-width, e.g. `uint8`: unsigned integer.

## Constants

Constants may be given directly as decimal based numbers (eg. `1234`),
or can be given with a specified bit width and base:

-   `3b0101`, 3 bits wide value 5.

-   `32hffff`, 32 bits wide value 65535.

-   `4d10`, 4 bits wide value 10.

Supported base identifiers are: `b` for binary, `h` for hexadecimal, `d`
for decimal. If the value does not fit the bit width, it is clamped.

## Variables

Variables are declared with the following pattern:

-   `TYPE ID = VALUE;` initializes the variable with value on algorithm
    start / reset.

-   `TYPE ID(VALUE);` initializes the variable with value on *power-up*
    (when the FPGA is configured).

where `TYPE` is a type definition
(Section <a href="#sec:types" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:types">3.1</a>),
`ID` a variable identifier (starting with a letter followed by
alphanumeric or underscores) and `VALUE` a constant
(Section <a href="#sec:csts" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:csts">3.2</a>).

The initializer is mandatory, and is always a simple constant (no
expressions), or the special value `uninitialized`. The later indicates
that the initialization can be skipped, reducing design size. This is
particularly interesting on brams/broms and register arrays.

## Tables

`intN tbl[M] = {...} `

Example: `int6 tbl[4] = {0,0,0,0};`

Table sizes have to be constant at compile time. The initializer is
mandatory and can be a string, in which case each letter becomes its
ASCII value, and the string is null terminated.

The table size `M` is optional (eg. `int4 tbl[]={1,2,3};` ) in which
case the size is automatically derived from the initializer (strings
have one additional implicit character: the null terminator).

If the table size is specified and the initializer is a shorter string,
the table is automatically padded with zeros. A longer string results in
an error.

If the table size is specified and the initializer – not a string – has
a different number of elements, an error occurs. However, if a smaller
number of elements is given the last element can be `pad(value)` in
which case the remainder of the table is filled with `value`.

Example: `int6 tbl[256] = {0,0,0,0,pad(255)};`

Example: `int6 tbl[256] = {pad(0)};`

The keyword `uninitialized` may be used to explicitly skip table
initialization, in which case the initial table state is unknown:
`int6 tbl[4] = uninitialized;`.

Similarly, the padding can be uninitialized:
`int6 tbl[256] = {0,0,0,0,pad(uninitialized)};`. In this case, only the
first part of the table will be initialized, the state of the other
values will be unknown.

Tables can also be initialized from file content, but only for specific bit-widths (currently 8 bits and 32 bits). 

Example: `int32 tbl[256] = {file("data.img"), pad(0)};`

This loads as many as possible 32 bits values from file `data.img` and pads the rest with zeros.

## Block RAMs / ROMs

`bram intN tbl[M] = {...} `

Block RAMs are declared in a way similar to tables. Block RAMs map to
special FPGA blocks and avoid using FPGA LUTs to store data. However,
accessing a block RAM typically requires a one-cycle latency.

> **Important:** Block RAMs are only initialized at *power-up* (when the FPGA is configured).

A block RAM variable has four members accessible with the ’dot’ syntax:
- `addr` the address being accessed,
- `wenable` set to 1 if writing, set to 0 if reading,
- `rdata` result of read,
-  `wdata` data to be written.

Here is an example of using a block RAM in Silice:

``` c
bram int8 table[4] = {42,43,44,45};
int8 a = 0;

table.wenable = 0; // read
table.addr    = 2; // third entry
++:                // wait on clock
a = table.rdata;   // now a == 44
```

Finally, an advanced option lets you indicate that the BRAM inputs need
not be latched:

``` c
bram int8 table<input!>[4] = uninitialized;
```

This is used to minimize a design size ; however the caller has to
ensure values are all properly present at the right cycle when
reading/writing.

The rules for initializers of BRAMs are the same as for tables.

#### Block ROMs

ROMs use a similar syntax, using `brom` instead of `bram`.

#### Dual-port RAMs

A dual-port block RAM has eight members accessible with the ’dot’
syntax:

- `addr0` the address being accessed on port 0,
- `wenable0` write enable on port 0,
- `rdata0` result of read on port 0,
- `wdata0` data to be written on port 0,
- `addr1` the address being accessed on port 1
- `wenable1` write enable on port 1,
- `rdata1` result of read on port 1,
- `wdata1` data to be written on port1.

The dual-port BRAM also has optional clock parameters for port0 and
port1.

Here is an example of using a block RAM in Silice with different clocks:

``` c
dualport_bram int8 table<@clock0,@clock1>[4] = {42,43,44,45};
```

## Operators

### Swizzling

``` c
int6 a = 0;
int1 b = a[1,1]; // second bit
int2 c = a[1,2]; // int2 with second and third bits
int3 d = a[2,3]; // int3 with third, fourth and fifth bits
```

The first entry may be an expression, the second has to be a constant.

### Arithmetic, comparison, bit-wise, reduction, shift

All standard Verilog operators are supported, binary and unary.

### Concatenation

Concatenation allows to combine expressions to form expressions having
larger bit-width. The syntax is to form a comma separated list enclosed
by braces. Example:

``` c
  int6  i = 6b111000;
  int2  j = 2b10;
  int10 k = 0;
  k := {j,i,2b11};
```

Here c is obtained by concatenating a,b and the constant 2b11 to form a
ten bits wide integer.

Bits can also be replicated with a syntax similar to Verilog:

``` c
  uint2  a = 2b10;
  uint9  c = 0;
  c := { 1b0, {8{a[1,1]}} };
```

Here the last eight bits of variable c are set to the second bit of a.

### Bindings

Silice defines operators for bindings the input/output of algorithms and
modules:

-   `<:` binds right to left,
-   `:>` binds left to right,
-   `<:>` binds both ways.

The bound sides have to be VIO identifiers. To bind expressions you can
use expression tracking (see
Section <a href="#sec:exprtrack" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:exprtrack">3.6.6</a>).

Bound VIOs are connected and immediately track each others values. A
good way to think of this is as a physical wire between IC pins, where
each VIO is a pin. Bindings are specified when instantiating algorithms
and modules.

The bidirectional binding is reserved for two use cases:

-  binding `inout` variables,
-  binding groups (see
    Section <a href="#sec:groups" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:groups">3.7</a>)
    and interfaces (see
    Section <a href="#sec:interfaces" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:interfaces">3.8</a>).

There are two other versions of the binding operators:

-   `<::` binds right to left, using value *at latest clock rising edge*,

-   `<::>` binds an IO group, using value *at latest clock rising edge for    inputs*.

Normally, the bound inputs are tracking the value of the bound VIO as changed during the current clock cycle. Therefore, the
tracking algorithm/module immediately gets new values (in other words,
there is a direct connection). 
This, however, produces deeper circuits and can reduce the max frequency of a design. These operators allow to bind the value as it was at the cycle start (positive clock edge). 
This introduces a one cycle latency before the algorithm/module sees the change, but makes the resulting circuit less deep. See also the [notes on algorithms calls, bindings and timings](AlgoInOuts.md).

> **Note:** when a VIO is bound both to an algorithm input and and algorithm output (making a direct connection between two instantiated algorithms), then using `<::` or `<:` will result in the same behavior, which is controlled by the use of `output` or `output!` on the algorithm driving the output. This will be clarified in the future, see [issue #49](https://github.com/sylefeb/Silice/issues/49).


### Always assign

Silice defines operators for always assignment of VIOs. An always
assignment is performed regardless of the execution state. It happens
before anything else and can be overridden from the algorithm. Always
assignments are order dependent between them.
The left side of the assignment has to be a VIO identifier, while the right side may be an expression.

-   `:=` assign right to left at each rising clock,

-   `::=` assign right to left with a one clock cycle delay (two stages
    flip-flop for e.g. clock domain crossing).

Always assignments are specified just after variable declarations
and algorithms/modules instantiations. A typical use case is to make
something pulse high, for instance:

``` c
algorithm writer(
  output uint1 write, // pulse high to write
  output uint8 data,  // byte to write
  // ...
) {

  write := 0; // maintain low with always assign
  // ...
  if (do_write) {
    data  = ...;
    write = 1; // pulses high on next rising clock
  }
  
}
```

> **Note:** the assignment is performed before anything else. If the value of the expression in the right hand side is later changing (during the clock cycle), this will not change the value of the left hand side. To achieve this use *bound expressions* (see next).

> **Note:** If the right hand side of a `:=` contains an asynchronous input, the always assignement will not register it. The always assignment tracks the input value immediately as it changes. To register an input use `::=` instead.

### Bound expressions

Variables can be defined to constantly track the value of an expression,
hence *binding the variable* and the expression. This is done during the
variable declaration, using either the *&lt;:* or *&lt;::* binding
operators. Example:

``` c
algorithm adder(
  output uint9 o,
  // ...
) {
  uint8 a = 1;
  uint8 b = 2;
  uint9 a_plus_b <: a + b;
  
  a = 15;
  b = 3;
  o = a_plus_b; // line 11
}
```

In this case *o* gets assigned 15+3 on line 11, as it tracks immediate
changes to the expression *a+b*. Note that the variable *a\_plus\_b*
becomes read only (in Verilog terms, this is now a wire). We call *o* an
expression tracker.

The second operator, *&lt;::* tracks the expression using the values of
the variables *as they where at the previous clock rising edge*. If used
in this example, o would be assigned 1+2.

Bound expression can refer to other bound expressions, however *&lt;:*
and *&lt;::* cannot be mixed. (They could be in technical terms, but
this was found to quickly lead to confusion).

## Groups

Often, we want to pass around variables that form conceptual groups,
like the interface to a controller or a 2D point. Silice has a specific mechanism to
help with that. A group is declared as:

``` c
// SDRAM interface
group sdram_32b_io
{
  uint24 addr       = 0,
  uint1  rw         = 0,
  uint32 data_in    = 0,
  uint32 data_out   = 0,
  uint1  busy       = 1,
  uint1  in_valid   = 0,
  uint1  out_valid  = 0
}
```

Note that group declarations are made *outside* of algorithms.

A group variable can be declared directly:

``` c
sdram_32b_io sd; // init values are defined in the group declaration
```

To pass a group variable to an algorithm, we need to define an interface
(see also
Section <a href="#sec:interfaces" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:interfaces">3.8</a>).
This will further specify which group members are input and outputs:

``` c
algorithm sdramctrl(
  // ..
  // anonymous interface
  sdram_provider sd {
    input   addr,       // address to read/write
    input   rw,         // 1 = write, 0 = read
    input   data_in,    // data from a read
    output  data_out,   // data for a write
    output  busy,       // controller is busy when high
    input   in_valid,   // pulse high to initiate a read/write
    output  out_valid   // pulses high when data from read is
}    
) {
  // ..
```

Binding to the algorithm is then a single line ; in the parent:

``` c
sdramctrl memory(
  sd <:> sd,
  // ..
);
```

The `<::>` operator can also be used in the binding of an interface (see Section <a href="#sec:bindings" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:bindings">3.6.4</a>).

A group can be passed in a call if the algorithm describes an anonymous interface. If the interface has both inputs and outputs, the group can appear both as an input and an output in the call.

> **Note:** A group cannot contain tables nor other groups.

## Anonymous interfaces

Interfaces can be declared for a group during algorithm definition.  

```c
group point {
  int16 x = 0,
  int16 y = 0
}

algorithm foo(
  point p0 {
    input x,
    input y,
  },
  point p1 {
    input x,
    input y,
  }
) {
  // ..
```

To simplify the above, and when group members are all bound either as inputs or outputs, as simpler syntax exists:
```c
algorithm foo(
  input point p0,
  input point p1
) {
  // ..
```

Anonymous interfaces allow groups to be given as parameters during calls.

## Named interfaces

Named interfaces are ways to describe what inputs and outputs an algorithm expects, without knowing in advance the exact specification of these fields (e.g. their widths). 
Besides making algorithm IO description more compact, this provides genericity. 

Named interfaces **have** to be bound to a group
(Section <a href="#sec:groups" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:groups">3.7</a>) or an interface upon algorithm instantiation. They cannot be used to pass a group in a call. The binding does not have to be complete: it is possible to bind to an interface a group having **more** (not less) members than the interface.

Reusing the example of
Section <a href="#sec:groups" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:groups">3.7</a>
we can define a named interface ahead of time:

``` c
interface sdram_provider {
  input   addr,       // address to read/write
  input   rw,         // 1 = write, 0 = read
  input   data_in,    // data from a read
  output  data_out,   // data for a write
  output  busy,       // controller is busy when high
  input   in_valid,   // pulse high to initiate a read/write
  output  out_valid   // pulses high when data from read is
}
```

And then the sdram controller algorithm declaration simply becomes:

``` c
  algorithm sdramctrl(
    // interface
    sdram_provider sd,
    // ..
  ) {
    // ..
```

Note than the algorithm is now using a named interface, it does not
know in advance the width of the signals in the interface. This is
determined at binding time, when a group is bound to the interface.
Interfaces can be bound to other interfaces, the information is
propagated when a group is bound at the top level.

For instance, we may define another group as follows, which uses 8 bits
instead of 32 bits:

``` c
  // SDRAM interface
  group sdram_8b_io
  {
    uint24 addr       = 0,
    uint1  rw         = 0,
    uint8  data_in    = 0,
    uint8  data_out   = 0,
    uint1  busy       = 1,
    uint1  in_valid   = 0,
    uint1  out_valid  = 0
  }
```

This group can be bound to the `sdramctrl` controller, which now will
receive 8 bits signals for `data_in`/`data_out`.

The `sdramctrl` controller can adjust to this change, using `sameas` and
`widthof`. The first, `sameas`, allows to declare a variable the same as
another:

``` c
sameas(sd.data_in) tmp;
```

The second, `widthof`, returns the width of a signal:

``` c
while (i < (widthof(sd.data_in) >> 3)) {
  // ...
}
```

> **Note:** In the future Silice will provide compile time checks, for instance verifying the width of a signal is a specific value.


## Bitfields

There are many cases where we pack multiple data in a larger variable,
for instance:

``` c
  uint32 data = 32hffff1234;
  // ..
  left  = data[ 0,16];
  right = data[16,16];
```

The hard coded values make this type of code quite hard to read and
difficult to maintain. To cope with that, Silice defines bitfields. A
bitfield is first declared:

``` c
bitfield Node {
  uint16 right,
  uint16 left
}
```

Note that the first entry in the list is mapped to the higher bits of
the field.

This can then be used during access, to unpack the data:

``` c
left  = Node(data).left;
right = Node(data).right;
```

There is no overhead to the mechanism, and different bitfield can be
used on a same variable depending on the context (e.g. instruction
decoding).

The bitfield can also be used to initialize the wider variable:

``` c
uint32 data = Node(left=16hffff,right=16h1234);
```

## Intrinsics

Silice has convenient intrinsics:

-   `__signed(exp)` indicates the expression is signed (Verilog
    `$signed`)

-   `__unsigned(exp)` indicates the expression is unsigned (Verilog
    `$unsigned`)

-   `__display(format_string,value0,value1,...)` maps to Verilog
    `$display` allowing text output during simulation.

# Algorithms

Algorithms are the main elements of a Silice design. An algorithm is a 
specification of a circuit implementation. Thus, like modules in
Verilog, algorithms have to be instanced before being used. Each
instance becomes an actual physical layout on the final design. An
algorithm can instance other algorithms and Verilog modules.

Instanced algorithms *always run in parallel*. However they can be
called synchronously (implying a wait state in the caller). They may run
forever and start automatically. Each may be driven from a specific
clock and reset signal.

#### main (entry point).

The top level algorithm is called *main* and has to be defined. It is
automatically instanced by the *host hardware framework*, see
Section <a href="#sec:host" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:host">8</a>.

## Declaration

An algorithm is declared as follows:

``` verilog
algorithm ID (
input TYPE ID
...
output TYPE ID
...
output! TYPE ID
...
) <MODS> {
  DECLARATIONS
  SUBROUTINES
  ALWAYS_ASSIGNMENTS
  ALWAYS_BLOCK
  INSTRUCTIONS
}
```

Most elements are optional: the number of inputs and outputs can vary,
the modifiers may be empty (in which case the `’<>’` is not necessary)
and declarations, bindings and instructions may all be empty.

Here is a simple example:

``` c
algorithm adder(intput uint8 a,intput uint8 b,output uint8 v)
{
  v = a + b;
}
```

Let us now discuss each element of the declaration.

#### *Inputs and outputs.*

Inputs and outputs may be declared in any order, however the order
matters when calling the algorithms (parameters are given in the order
of inputs, results are read back in the order of outputs). Input and
outputs can be single variables or tables. A third type `inout` exists
for compatibility with Verilog modules, however these can only be passed
and bound to imported modules (i.e. they cannot be used in expressions
and instructions for now).

Note that there are two types of output: `output` and `output!`. These
distinguish between a standard and an immediate output (exclamation
mark). A standard output sees its value updated at the next clock cycle.
An immediate output ensures that callers sees the results within the
same cycle. This can be for instance important when implementing a video
driver; e.g. a HDMI module generates a pixel coordinate on its output
and expects to see the corresponding color on its input within the same
clock cycle (even though a better design would allow a one-cycle
latency). In such a scenario the algorithm outputting the color to the
HDMI driver will input the coordinate and use `output!` for the color.
However, using only `output!` will in some cases result in combinational
loops: a cycle in the described circuitry (that is generally bad).
Silice detects such cases and will issue an error (see also
Section <a href="#combloops" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="combloops">4.6</a>).

> **Note:** Silice combinational loop detection is not perfect yet. Such a problem would typically result in simulation hanging (unable to stabilize the circuit) with Verilator issuing a `UNOPTFLAT` warning.

#### *Declarations.*

Variables, instanced algorithms and instanced modules have to be
declared first (in any order). A simple example:

``` c
algorithm main(output uint8 led)
{
  uint8 r = 0;
  adder ad1;
  
  // ... btw this is a comment
}
```

## Instantiation

Algorithms and modules can be instanced from within a parent algorithm.
Optionally parameters can be *bound* to the parent algorithm variables.
In terms of hardware, these are the wires connecting instanced and
parent algorithms. Instantiation uses the following syntax:

``` verilog
MOD_ALG ID<@CLOCK,!RESET> (
BINDINGS
(<:auto:>)
);
```

where `MOD_ALG` is the name of the module/algorithm, `ID` an identifier
for the instance, and `BINDINGS` a comma separated list of bindings
between the instance inputs/outputs and the parent algorithm variables.
The bindings are optional and may be partial. `@CLOCK` optionally
specifies a clock signal, `!RESET` a reset signal, where `CLOCK` and
`RESET` have to be `uint1` variables in the parent algorithm. Both are
optional, and if none is specified the brackets `<>` can be skipped.
When none are specified the parent `clock` and `reset` are used for the
instance.

Each binding is defined as: `ID_left OP ID_right` where `ID_left` is the
identifier of an instance input or output, `OP` a binding operator
(Section <a href="#sec:bindings" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:bindings">3.6.4</a>)
and `ID_right` a variable identifier.

Note that only identifiers are allowed in bindings: access to tables and
swizzling are not allowed. This can be alleviated using bound
expressions, see
Section <a href="#sec:exprtrack" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:exprtrack">3.6.6</a>.

Combined with `autorun` such bindings allow to instantiate and
immediately run an algorithm to drive some of the parent algorithm
variables. Here is an example:

``` c
algorithm blink(output int1 b_fast,output int1 b_slow) <autorun>
{
  uint20 counter = 0;
  while (1) {
    counter = counter + 1;
      if (counter[0,8] == 0) {
        b_fast = !b_fast;
      }
      if (counter == 0) {
        b_slow = !b_slow;
      }
  }
}

algorithm main(output int8 led)
{
  int1 a = 0;
  int1 b = 0;
  blink b0(
    b_slow :> a,
    b_fast :> b
  );

  led := 0;      // turn off all eight LEDs
  led[0,1] := a; // first LED  always assigned first bit (slow blink)
  led[1,1] := b; // second LED always assigned second bit (faster blink)

  while (1) { } // inifinite loop, blink runs in parallel
}
```

This example reveals some interesting possibilities, and a constraint.
As algorithm `blink` is instanced as `b0`, it starts running immediately
(due to the `autorun` modifier in the declaration of `blink`). Hence,
the variables `a` and `b` are immediately reflecting the `b_slow` and
`b_fast` outputs of `b0`. The always assignment to `led` then use `a`
and `b` to output to the `led` 8-bit variable, which we assume is
physically connected to LEDs. The first assignment sets `led` to zero,
and then its two first bits to `a` and `b`. As the always assignments
are order dependent, this behaves properly with the two first bits
always assigned at each clock cycle. Since all updates in `main` are
done through bindings and always assignments, and because *algorithms
run in parallel*, there is nothing else to do, and `main` enters an
infinite loop (runs as long as there is power).

The constraint, however, is that `a` and `b` are necessary. This is due
to the fact that we cannot directly bind `led[0,1]` and `led[1,1]` to
the instance of `blink`. Only identifiers can be specified during
bindings. This can be alleviated by using bound expressions (see
Section <a href="#sec:exprtrack" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:exprtrack">3.6.6</a>).

#### Automatic binding.

The optional `<:auto:>` tag allows to automatically bind matching
identifiers: the compiler finds all valid left/right identifier pairs
having the same name and binds them directly. While this is convenient
when many bindings are repeated and passed around, it is recommended to
use groups for brevity and make all bindings explicit.

> **Note** automatic binding can be convenient, but is discouraged as it relies a name matching and changes can introduce silent errors. When a large number of inputs/outputs have to be bound, consider using groups and interfaces.

#### Direct access to inputs and outputs.

The inputs and outputs of instanced algorithms, when not bound, can be
directly accessed using a ’dot’ notation. Outputs can be read and inputs
written to. Example:

``` c
algorithm algo(input uint8 i,output uint o)
{
  o = i;
}

algorithm main(output uint8 led)
{
  algo a;
  a.i = 131;
  () <- a <- (); // this is a call without explicit inputs/outputs
  led = a.o;
}
```

## Call

Algorithms may be called synchronously or asynchronously, with or
without parameters. Only instanced algorithms may be called.

See also the detailed [notes on algorithms calls, bindings and timings](AlgoInOuts.md).

The asynchronous call syntax is as follows:

``` verilog
ID <- (P_1,...,P_N); // with parameters
ID <- (); // without parameters
```

Where `ID` is the instanced algorithm name. When the call is made with
parameters, all have to be specified. The parameters are given in the
same order they are declared in the algorithm being called. The call
without parameters is typically used when inputs are bound or specified
directly. Note that when parameters are bound, only the call without
parameters is possible.

When an asynchronous call is made, the instanced algorithm will start
processing at the next clock cycle. The algorithm runs in parallel to
the caller and any other instanced algorithm. To wait and obtain the
result, the join syntax is used:

``` verilog
(V_1,...,V_N) <- ID; // with receiving variables
() <- ID; // without receiving variables
```

> **Note:** Calling algorithms across clock domains is not yet supported. For such cases, autorun with bindings is recommended.

## Subroutines

Algorithms can contain subroutines. These are local routines that can be
called by the algorithm multiple times. A subroutine takes parameters,
and has access to the variables, instanced algorithms and instanced
modules of the parent algorithm – however access permissions have to be
explicitly given. Subroutines offer a simple mechanism to allow for the
equivalent of local functions, without having to wire all the parent
algorithm context into another module/algorithm. Subroutines can also
declare local variables, visible only to their scope. Subroutines avoid
duplicating a same functionality over and over, as their code is
synthesized a single time in the design, regardless of the number of
times they are called.

A subroutine is declared as:

``` verilog
subroutine ID(
input TYPE ID
...
output TYPE ID
...
reads ID
...
writes ID
...
readwrites ID
...
calls ID
) {
  DECLARATIONS
  INSTRUCTIONS
  return;
}
```

(a final return is optional)

Here are simple examples:

``` c
algorithm main(output uint8 led)
{
  uint8  a       = 1;

  subroutine shift_led(readwrites a) {
    a = a << 1;
    if (a == 0) {
      a = 1;
    }
  }

  subroutine wait() {
    uint20 counter = 0;
    while (counter != 0) {
      counter = counter + 1;
    }
  }
    
  led := a;
  
  while(1) {
    () <- wait <- ();
    () <- shift_led <- ();
  }
}
```

*Subroutines permissions.* Subroutine permissions ensure only those
variables given read/write permission can be manipulated. This mitigates
the fact that a subroutine may directly manipulate variables in the
parent algorithm. The format for the permissions is a comma separated
list using keywords `reads`, `writes`, `readwrites`  
*Why subroutines?* There is a fundamental difference between a
subroutine and an algorithm called from a host: the subroutine never
executes in parallel, while a child algorithm could. However, if this
parallelism is not necessary, subroutines offer a simple mechanism to
repeat internal tasks.  
 

*Global subroutines* Subroutines may be declared outside of an
algorithm. Such subroutines are called *global* and may be called from
any algorithm. This is convenient to share subroutines across
algorithms. If a global subroutine requests access to parent algorithm
variables (read/write permissions), an algorithm calling the subroutine
has to have a matching set of variables in its scope. Note that global
subroutines are not technically shared, but rather copied in each
calling algorithm’s scope at compile time.

*Nested calls*

Subroutines can call other subroutines, and have to declare this is the
case using the keyword `calls`.

``` c
subroutine wait(input uint24 delay)
{
  // ...
}
subroutine init_device(calls wait)
{
  // ...
  () <- wait <- (1023);
}
```

Note that re-entrant calls (subroutine calling itself, even through
other subroutines) are not possible.

## Circuitry

Sometimes, it is useful to write a generic piece of code that can be
instantiated within a design. Such an example is a piece of circuitry to
write into an SDRAM, which bit width may not ne known in advance.

A circuitry offers exactly this mechanism in Silice. It is declared as:

``` verilog
circuitry ID(
input ID
output ID
inout ID
) {
INSTRUCTIONS
}
```

Note that there is no type specification on inputs/outputs as these are
resolved during instantiation. Here is an example of circuitry:

``` verilog
circuitry writeData(inout sd,input addr,input data) {
  // wait for sdram to not be busy
  while (sd.busy) { /*waiting*/ }
  // write!
  sd.data_in      = rdata;
  sd.addr         = addr;
  sd.in_valid     = 1;
}
```

Note the use of inout for sd (which is a group, see
Section <a href="#sec:groups" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:groups">3.7</a>).
A circuitry is not called, it is instantiated. This means that every
instantiation is indeed a duplication of the circuitry.

Here is the syntax for instantiation:

``` verilog
(output_0,...,output_N) = ID(input_0,...input_N)
```

As for algorithms and subroutines, inputs and outputs have to appear in
the order of declaration in the lists. An inout appears twice, both as
output and input. Following the previous example here is the
instantiation from an algorithm:

``` verilog
(sd) = writeData(sd,myaddr,abyte);
```

> **Note:** currently circuitry instantiation can only be made on VIO identifiers (no expressions, no bit-select or part-select). This restriction will be removed at some point. In the meantime bound expressions provide a work around, first defining a bound expression with an identifier then giving it to the circuitry (these can be defined in a block around the circuit instantiation).

## Combinational loops

When writing code, you may encounter a case where the Silice compiler
raises an error due to an expression leading to a combinational loop.
This indicates that the sequence of operations is leading to a cyclic
dependency in the circuit being described. These are in most cases
undesirable as they lead to unpredictable hardware behaviors.

A trivial solution is such a situation is to split the circuit loop
using the *step* operator (see
Section <a href="#sec:step" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:step">5.1</a>).
However, this will change you sequence of operations and the designer
may choose a different approach. Therefore Silice reports and error and
invites to either manually add a step, or to revise the code. In many
cases a slight rewrite avoids the issue entirely.

Example of a combinational loop:

``` c
algorithm main()
{
  uint8 a = 0;
  uint8 b = 0;
  // ...
  a = b + 1;
  a = a + 1; // triggers a combinational loop error
}
```

So what happens? It might seem that `a = a + 1` is the problem here, as
it writes as a cyclic dependency. In fact, that is not the sole cause.
On its own, this expression is perfectly fine: for each variable Silice
tracks to versions, the value at the cycle start and the value being modified (corresponding to a hardware flip-flip DQ pair). So `a = a + 1` in fact means
*a*<sub>current</sub> = *a*<sub>previous</sub> + 1. In fact, the code describes the circuit to update *a*<sub>previous</sub> from *a*<sub>current</sub>.

The problem here comes from the prior assignment to *a*, `a = b + 1`. 
This already sets a new value for *a*<sub>current</sub>, and thus the next expression
`a = a + 1` would have to use this new value. This now leads to
*a*<sub>current</sub> = *a*<sub>current</sub> + 1
which this time is a combinational loop: a circuit that forms a closed loop.

A possible solution is to insert a cycle in between:

``` c
a = b + 1;
++: // wait one cycle
a = a + 1; // now this is fine
```

Another is to rewrite as (!):
``` c
a = b + 2;
```

> **Note:** Silice does not attempt to fix loops on its own, even in such simple cases. This may change in the future. However Silice has a gold rule to *never* introduce cycles or flip-flops that could not be predicted by the designer.

It would be difficult to manually keep track of all potential
chains, especially as they can occur through bindings, which is why Silice does it for you! In practice, such loops are
rarely encountered, and in most cases easily resolved with slight
changes to arithmetic and logic.

> **Note:** Silice combinational loop detection is not perfect yet. Such a problem would typically result in simulation hanging (unable to stabilize the circuit) with Verilator issuing a `UNOPTFLAT` warning.

## Always assignments

After declarations, optional always assignments can be specified. These
use the operators defined in
Section <a href="#sec:contassign" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:contassign">3.6.5</a>.
Always assignments allow to follow the value of an expression in a
variable, output, or instanced algorithm input or output. Contrary to
bound expressions
(Section <a href="#sec:exprtrack" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:exprtrack">3.6.6</a>),
the assigned values can be changed during a cycle.

Example:

``` c
algorithm main(output uint8 led)
{
  uint8 r = 0;
  adder ad1;

  led   := r;
  ad1.a := 1;
}
```

These assignments are always performed, before anything else in the algorithm. 
They are order dependent. For instance:

``` c
b := a;
c := b;
```

is not the same as:

``` c
c := b;
b := a;
```

In the first case, c will immediately take the value of a, while in the
second case c will take the value of a after one clock cycle. This is
useful, for instance, when crossing a clock domain as it allows to
implement a two stages flip-flop. In fact, Silice provides a shortcut
for exactly this purpose, making the temporary variable b unnecessary:

``` c
c ::= a;
```

## Always blocks

Algorithms can have two always blocks: `always_before` (or `always`) and
`always_after`. An always block has to be single cycle (no goto, while
or step operator inside). It is always running, regardless of the state
of the rest of the algorithm. The `always_before` block is executed
immediately after always assignments, and before anything else. The
`always_after` block is executed after everything else.

The syntax simply is:

``` c
always_before {
  // instructions
  // ...
}
```

Assigning a variable in an always before block or using an always
assignment is in fact equivalent, that is:

``` c
always_before {
  a = 0;
}
```

is functionally the same as

``` c
a := 0;
```

*Note:* variables changed in `always_after` blocks have to use power-up
initialization only.

## Clock and reset

All algorithms receive a `clock` and `reset` signal from their parent
algorithm. These are intrinsic variables, are always defined within the
scope of an algorithm and have type `int1`. The clock and reset can be
explicitly specified when an algorithm is instanced
(Section <a href="#sec:instantiation" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:instantiation">4.2</a>).

## Modifiers

Upon declaration, modifiers can be specified (see `<MODS>`) in the
declaration). This is a comma separated list of any of the following:

-   **Autorun.** Adding the `autorun` keyword will ask the compiler to
    run the algorithm upon instantiation, without waiting for an
    explicit call.

-   **Internal clock.** Adding a `@ID` specifies the use of an
    internally generated clock signal. It is then expected that the
    algorithm contains a `int1 ID = 0;` variable declaration, which is
    bound to the output of a module producing a clock signal. This is
    meant to be used together with Verilog PLLs, to produce new clock
    signals. The module producing the new clock will typically take
    `clock` as input and `ID` as output.

-   **Internal reset.** Adding a `!ID` specifies the use of an
    internally generated reset signal. It is then expected that the
    algorithm contains a `int1 ID = 0;` variable declaration, which is
    bound to the output of a module producing a reset signal. This may
    be used, for instance, to filter the signal from a physical reset
    button.

-   **Stack.** Adding the `stack:N` modifier (with N an integer &gt; 1)
    will allocate a stack of size N for the algorithm subroutine nested
    calls.

-   **One-hot.** Adding the `onehot` modifier will use a ’onehot’ state
    numbering for the algorithm state machine. On small algorithms with
    few states this can result in smaller, faster designs.

Here is an example:

``` c
  algorithm main(output int1 b) <autorun,@new_clock>
  {
    int1 new_clock = 0;

    my_pll pll(
      base_clock <: clock,
      gen_clock :> new_clock
    );

    // the main algorithm is sequenced by new_clock
    // ...
  }
```

Which signals are allowed as clocks and resets depends on the FPGA
architecture and vendor toolchain.

# Execution flow and cycle utilization rules

Upon compilation, Silice breaks down the code into a finite state
machine (FSM). Each state corresponds to a circuit that updates the variables 
within a single cycle, and selects the next state. 
We next call these circuits *combinational chains*.

Silice attempts to form the longest combinational chains, or equivalently 
to minimize the number of states in the FSM. That is because going from one 
state to the next requires one clock cycle, delaying further computations. 
Of course, longer combinational chains also lead to reduced clock frequency, 
so there is a tradeoff. This is why Silice lets you explicitly specify
where to cut a combinational chain using the step operator `++:`

Note that if a state contains several independent combinational chain,
they will execute as parallel circuits (e.g. two computations regarding
different sets of variables). Grouping such computations in a same state
increases parallelism, without deepening the combinational chains.

The use of control flow structures such as `while` (or `goto`), as well
as synchronization with other algorithm also require introducing states.
This results in additional cycles being introduced. Silice follows a set
of precise rules to do this, so you always know what to expect.

## The step operator

Placing a `++:` in the sequence of operations of an algorithm explicitly
asks Silice to wait for exactly one cycle at this precise location in
the execution flow. Each next `++:` waits one additional cycle.

This has several important applications such as waiting for a memory
read/write, or breaking down long combinational chains that would
violate timing.

## Control flow

The most basic control flow operation is `goto`. While it may be used
directly, it is recommended to prefer higher level primitives such as
`while` and subroutines, because `goto` often leads to harder to read
and maintain code[3]. Yet, they are a fundamental low-level operation
and Silice is happy to expose them for your enjoyment!

`goto` always requires one cycle to ’jump’: this is a change of state in
the FSM. Entering a `while` takes one cycle and then, if there is a
single combinational chain inside, it takes exactly one cycle per
iteration. Exiting a `while` takes one cycle ; however when chaining
loops only one cycle is required to enter the next loop. So the first
loop adds two cycles, any additional loop afterwards adds a single cycle
if there is nothing in between them.

Now, `if-then-else` is slightly more subtle. When applied to sequences
of operations not requiring any control flow, an `if-then-else`
synthesizes to a combinational `if-then-else`. This means that both the
’if’ and ’else’ code are evaluated in parallel as combinational chains,
and a multiplexer selects which one is the result based on the
condition. This applies recursively, so combinational `if-then-else` may
be nested.

When the `if-then-else` contains additional control flow (e.g. a
subroutine call, a `while`, a `++:`, a `goto`, etc.) it is automatically
split into several states. It then takes one cycle to exit the ’if’ or
’else’ part and resume operations. If only the ’if’ or the ’else’
requires additional states while the other is a single combinational
chain (possibly empty), an additional state is still required to ’jump’
to what comes after the `if-then-else`. So in general this will cost one
cycle. However, in cases where this next state already exists, for
instance when the `if-then-else` is at the end of a `while` loop, this
existing state is reused resulting in no overhead.

This has interesting implications. Consider the following code:

``` c
while(...) {
  if (condition) {
    ...
++:
    ...    
  }
  a = b + 1; // line 7
}
```

When the `if` is not taken, we still have to pay one cycle to reach line
7. That is because it has been placed into a separate state to jump to
it since the `if` is *not* a one-cycle block (due to `++:`). Hence, the
while loop will always take at least two cycles.

However, you may choose to duplicate some code (and hence some
circuitry!) to avoid the extra cycle, rewriting as:

``` c
while(...) {
  if (condition) {
    ...
++:
    ...    
    a = b + 1;
  } else {
    a = b + 1;
  }
}
```

This works because when the `if` is taken the execution simply goes back
to the start of the `while`, a state that already exists. The `else`
being a one-cycle block followed by the start of the `while` no extra
cycle is necessary! We just tradeoff a bit of circuit size for extra
performance.

### Switches

Silice also supports the `switch-case` syntax, as follows:

``` c
switch( <EXPR> ) {
  case <CONST>: {  /* code for this case */    }
  case <CONST>: {  /* code for this case */    }
  default:      {  /* code for default case */ }
}  
```
where `<EXPR>` is an expression and `<CONST>` are constants. 

There is also a onehot version:
``` c
switch( <IDENTFIER> ) {
  case 0: {  /* code for this case */    }
  case 1: {  /* code for this case */    }
  ...
  case <W-1>: {  /* code for this case */    }
  default:    {  /* code for default case */ }
}  
```
where `<IDENTFIER>` is a variable of width `W` and each case is activated for
the corresponding bit of `<IDENTFIER>` being set to `1`, with all other bits set to `0`.
The `default` is only mandatory if not all bits are tested, and otherwise 
only necessary if `<IDENTFIER>` may be zero (not having a default while `<IDENTFIER>`
may be zero leads to undefined behaviors).

## Cycle costs of calls to algorithms and subroutines

A synchronized call to an algorithm takes at best two cycles: one cycle
for the algorithm to start processing, and one cycle to register that
the algorithm is done. An asynchronous call does not require additional
cycles (the called algorithm will start running on the next clock
cycle), while a synchronization inserts a state in the control flow and
always requires at least one additional cycle, even if the algorithm is
already finished.

A synchronized call to a subroutine takes at best two cycles: one cycle
to jump to the subroutine initial state, and one cycle to jump back.

> **Note:** Keep in mind that algorithms can also autorun and have their inputs/outputs bound to variables. Algorithms may also contain an `always_before` or `always_after` blocks that are always running.

## Pipelining

**TODO:** describe syntax

# Lua preprocessor

A preprocessor allows to change the way the source code is seen by the
compiler. It sits between the input source code and the compiler, and
basically rewrites the original source code in a different way, before
it is input to the compiler. This allows compile-time behaviors, such as
adapting the code to a target platform.

Having a strong preprocessor is important for hardware design. For
instance, designing a sort network of some size *N* is best done by
generating the code automatically from a preprocessor, so that one can
easily reuse the same code for different values of *N*. The same is true
of a division algorithm for some bit width, or for the pre-computations
of lookup tables.

The Silice preprocessor is built above the Lua
language <https://lua.org>. Lua is an amazing powerful, lightweight
scripting language that originated in the Computer Graphics community.
The preprocessor is thus not just a macro system, but a fully fledged
programming language.

## Principle and syntax

Preprocessor code is directly interleaved with Silice code. At any
point, the source code can be escaped to the preprocessor by starting a
line with $$. The full line is then considered as preprocessor Lua code.

The pre-processor sees Silice source lines as strings to be output.
Thus, it outputs to the compiler any line that is met during the
execution of the preprocessor. This means it does not output those that
are not reached, and it outputs multiple times those that appear in a
loop.

Let’s make a quick example:

``` c
algorithm main()
{

$$if true then
  uint8 a=0;
  uint8 b=0;
$$end

$$if false then
uint8 c=0;
$$end

$$for i=0,1 do
b = a + 1;
$$end
}
```

The code output by the preprocessor is:

``` c
algorithm main()
{

uint8 a=0;
uint8 b=0;

b = a + 1;
b = a + 1;

}
```

Note that source code lines are either fully Silice, of fully
preprocessor (starting with $$). A second syntax allows to use
preprocessor variables directly in Silice source code, simply doing
$`varname`$ with `varname` the variable from the preprocessor context.
In fact, a full Lua expression can be used in between the $ signs; this
expression is simply concatenated to the surrounding Silice code.

Here is an example:

``` c
algorithm main()
{
$$for i=0,3 do
uint8 a_$i$ = $100+i$;
$$end
}
```

The code output by the preprocessor is:

``` c
algorithm main()
{
uint8 a_0 = 100;
uint8 a_1 = 101;
uint8 a_2 = 102;
uint8 a_3 = 103;
}
```

If a large chunk of Lua code has to be written, you can simply write it
in a separate `.lua` file and use:

``` c
$$dofile('some_lua_code.lua')
```

## Includes

The preprocessor is also in charge of including other Silice source code
files, using the syntax `$include(’source.ice’)`. This loads the entire
file (and recursively its own included files) into the preprocessor
execution context.

## Pre-processor image and palette functions

The pre-processor has a number of function to facilitate the inclusion
of images and palette data ; please refer to the example projects
`vga_demo`, `vga_wolfpga` and `vga_doomchip`.

# Interoperability with Verilog modules

Silice can inter-operate with Verilog.

Verilog source code can be included in two different ways:
`append(’code.v’)` and `import(’code.v’)` where `code.v` is a Verilog
source code file.

## Append

Append is very simple: the Verilog source code is directly appended to
the output of the compiler (which is a Verilog source code) without any
processing. This makes this Verilog code available for other Verilog
modules, in particular those that are imported (see next). The reason
for `append` is that Silice is currently not able to fully parse Verilog
when importing.

## Import

Import is the most interesting way to inter-operate with Verilog. Once
imported, all Verilog modules from the Verilog source file will be
available for inclusion in algorithms.

The modules are instantiated in a very similar way as algorithms, with
bindings to variables. However, modules cannot be called like
algorithms, and the ’dot’ syntax to read/write outputs and inputs is not
available for modules.

## Wrapping

Due to the fact that Silice only understands a subset of Verilog, there
are cases where a module cannot be imported directly. In such cases,
wrapping offers a solution. The idea is to write a simpler Verilog
module that can be imported by Silice and wraps the instantiation of the
more complex one.

Then the complex module is included with `append` and the wrapper with
`import`.

# Host hardware frameworks

The host hardware framework typically consists in a Verilog glue file.
The framework is appended to the compiled Silice design (in Verilog).
The framework instantiates the *main* algorithm. The resulting file can
then be processed by the vendor or open source FPGA toolchain (often
accompanied by a hardware constraint file).

Silice comes with the following host hardware frameworks:

-   **mojo\_basic** : framework to compile for the Alchitry Mojo 3 FPGA
    board.

-   **mojo\_hdmi\_sdram** : framework to compile for the Alchitry Mojo 3
    FPGA board equipped with the HDMI shield.

-   **icestick** : framework for the Lattice ice40 icestick board.

-   **icarus\_vga** : framework for use with the *icarus* hardware
    simulator, with vga emulation

For practical usage examples please refer to the *Getting started* guide
at <https://github.com/sylefeb/Silice/blob/master/GetStarted.md>.

## VGA emulation

Silice comes with a tool called `silicehe` for *Silice hardware
emulation*. This tool will read the output of the `icarus_vga` simulator
(the fst file storing signals) and produce a sequence of images from the
stored VGA signals.

Simply call it with the fst file as the second argument.
